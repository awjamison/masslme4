Title: Fit Many lme4 Models in Parallel

Description: masslme4 makes it easier to fit a large batch of lme4 models. It supports parallelization, working with large datasets, and enhanced condition handling. This package was originally designed for mass-univariate analysis of neuroimaging and EEG/MEG data where many models are fit independently (e.g. to each voxel or sensor) and a statistic (e.g. a cluster-level statistic) is computed by combining information in the different models.
